# ðŸ“˜ Discord-specific Rules

> Please keep in mind that common sense and respectful ethical behavior are expected from all members. These rules are not comprehensive, and use of loopholes to violate the spirit of these rules is subject to enforcement.

For appeals, reports, and general help with the server, please use **#support-ticket** so our staff team can properly assist you.

You can report Discord users and their messages via:
- **Right-click / Tap and hold > Apps > Report to LSCnR**
- **Ping `@unknown-role`** if there is something requiring immediate attention (e.g., mass spammers, scammers, or rage hackers spawning objects, etc.)

## 1. Hate Speech
Hate speech and discriminatory language are strictly prohibited. This includes slurs and derogatory remarks about someone's race, ethnicity, country of origin, gender, sexual orientation, religion, and disability.

## 2. Inappropriate Content
Refrain from posting any content that is graphic or explicit. Posting or discussing gore, violence, cruelty, nudity, and pornography is strictly prohibited. We also do not allow in-depth discussions about politics or religion, as those topics are controversial and can generate hateful discussions.

## 3. Advertising
Unsolicited references and links to other social media, servers, communities, games, and services in chat or direct messages are not allowed. This also includes asking people to check your profile or to DM you with the intent of advertising.

## 4. Spam & Channel Usage
Please refrain from repeatedly sending the same message, irrelevant messages, unnecessary pings, or duplicate images/GIFs. Read the channel names and descriptions and use them only for their intended purpose. Use **#off-topic** for shitposting.

## 5. Private Information

Protect your own privacy and safety, as well as that of others, by not discussing, requesting, or sharing personal information, leaks, and other information that is not supposed to be public.

## 6. English Only
For easier moderation and communication, we currently only allow English in text and voice chat. We may revisit the idea of international channels in the future when we have more moderation capacity.

## 7. Discord's Rules
In addition to these server-specific rules, the [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Discord Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) apply.

## 8. Tagging Staff
Do not mention staff members unless there is an emergency requiring immediate action. In such cases, open a **#support-ticket** or ping `@Staff`.
