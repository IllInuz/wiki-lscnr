# ðŸ“‹ Rules

By playing on our server, you automatically agree to the rules. Please keep in mind that common sense and respectful ethical behavior are expected from all members. These rules are not comprehensive and use of loopholes to violate the spirit of these rules is subject to enforcement.

These rules cover your behavior in and around our server, as well as your username and character name. This server is also streamer friendly, so your behavior has to follow the Twitch / Kick Community Guidelines. In addition to these server-specific rules, the Cfx.re Platform Service Agreement applies when using FiveM.

## Quick Summary

* We do not allow attacking people without a valid reason (RDM)
* We do not allow cheating, exploiting bugs/unintended mechanics, or emoting in fights
* We do not allow combat logging or teaming up with the opposite team
* We do not allow discrimination, threats, hate speech, and other unethical or illegal behavior
* We do not allow impersonation, scams, or evading punishments
* We only allow English in Text & Voice chat

While there are specific rules in place, staff may make exceptions if approved by management. Please note that these rules are in a very early stage and are thus subject to change. It is important to always be aware of the current rules. Not knowing the rules does not exempt you from punishment.

For rule suggestions, updates on our rules, reports, appeals, as well as any other questions or concerns, please visit our discord server.

## General Conduct

Any sort of spamming, advertising, sexual harassment, discrimination and hate speech (racism, xenophobia, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, etc.) is not allowed.

You are also not allowed to threaten or dox others, wish death or serious illnesses upon someone, or host in-depth discussions about illegal real-world topics like crimes and controlled substances (unless these relate to in-game functions, of course).

We encourage everyone to be respectful, civil, and ethical. Playful banter like "f- you" or "f- your mom" is allowed, but if you abuse this rule and constantly spew serious insults at people or use synonyms for slurs and hate speech, you may be punished. Keep it cool â€” we're all here to have fun and enjoy the game!

Furthermore, we only allow English in Text & Voice chat. This allows for easier communication and moderation. We may revisit the idea of international chats or channels in the future when we have more moderation capacity.

## Cheating and Exploits

Using third-party hardware, software or tools, as well as exploiting unintentional mechanics, glitches or bugs to gain an unfair advantage over other players is not allowed. This includes using VPNs to cause lag/latency and "lag switching". It undermines the integrity of the game and ruins the fun for everyone.

### Star Baiting

You are not allowed to intentionally get other players a wanted level in an unfair way (star baiting).

### Clothing

You are strictly prohibited from using any clothing or accessories within the game that result in making parts of your character's body invisible or obscured. This includes items that manipulate textures, models, or other game assets to create the illusion of missing or hidden body parts.

### Emotes

You may not use emotes while you're in a fight or a chase, as they can give you an unfair advantage (e.g. taking cover in a way that's not normally possible). If you get attacked while emoting, you have to cancel the emote first before fighting back.

### Abusing the Cover System ("Ghost Peeking")

Abusing the cover system in a way where your bullets pass through walls is not allowed. We've decided not to allow this, even though it's a default GTA mechanic, because it's an unintended mechanic and can create very unfair scenarios where you can shoot your opponents but they are unable to hit you.

### Finding and Reporting Bugs and Exploits

If you stumble across a bug, you may not abuse it to your advantage. Limit your use of the bug to gathering evidence for the report, then report the bug in the #bug-reports channel in our Discord so we can fix it as soon as possible. Create a private support ticket on our Discord for any major exploits so they don't get abused. You may be compensated with in-game money or credits depending on the severity of the exploit.

## Combat Logging

Disconnecting or quitting intentionally during an ongoing combat situation or chase to avoid the consequences is strictly prohibited. This also includes intentionally killing yourself (e.g. drowning, exploding) to avoid a combat situation, a chase, or an arrest.

### Exceptions Where You May Combat Log

You may combat log if you've been in police custody for an unreasonable amount of time and are not being arrested. You may ALSO combat log if a cop is trying to kill you but you are not violent and not a threat. Additionally, you may combat log if a medic is trying to kill you but it's not in self-defense.

### Technical Difficulties

If you are experiencing a technical issue that forces you to quit or disconnect, we recommend clipping the situation using a program like Medal (ideally before quitting) to have proof of what happened. If you don't have proof for a situation where it's not obvious, you might still be punished as per our rules.

## Team Rules

Cops and medics are opponents to criminals. You can't team up or work with the opposite team. While cops and medics are on the same side, they have different duties, and medics shall not participate in any sort of law enforcement.

### Playing as a Civilian / Criminal / Bounty Hunter

You may not help a cop in their duties by teaming up or working with them to chase, attack or arrest others. You may bribe corrupt cops using the integrated bribe feature to avoid arrest. You can give cops and medics a ride as long as you are not wanted. You are not allowed to willingly engage in any criminal activity unless the cop or medic leaves your vehicle.

### Playing as a Cop

As a cop, you have the duty to protect the population of Los Santos. You can't watch someone commit a violent crime and ignore it. When spotting someone committing a violent crime, you have to interfere by attempting to either arrest or to kill the suspect(s), depending on the circumstances.

You may not help a citizen attack others or engage in criminal activity. You can only give medics, other cops and innocent civilians a ride. When giving a ride to a civilian or a medic, you are not allowed to engage in police activity until they leave the vehicle. If a civilian becomes wanted while you are in a vehicle with them, you must immediately stop the vehicle or bail out and attempt to detain or eliminate the criminal depending on the circumstance.

You can accept bribes using the bribe feature to gain some extra money. Be aware that accepting bribes loses you XP for being corrupt. You are not allowed to steal a bribe or an arrest for a situation that you were not involved in, search another cop's suspect without the cop's permission, or prevent another cop from arresting a suspect.

### Playing as a Medic

You may not help a citizen attack others or engage in criminal activity, and you may not help a cop with attacking or arresting a criminal. If there is an active shootout, you may only revive cops, other medics, and innocent civilians until the shootout is over. Once the shootout is over, you can revive criminals so the cops can arrest them. 

You can only give other medics, cops and innocent civilians a ride. When giving a ride to a civilian or cop, you are not allowed to engage in medical activity until they leave the vehicle. If a civilian becomes wanted while you are in a vehicle with them, you must immediately stop the vehicle or bail out, as you are not allowed to be in the same vehicle as them.

You are not allowed to steal the heal or revive of another medic if you are not involved in a situation or if they arrived first.

## Impersonation and Punishment Evasion

You are not allowed to deceive others by impersonating other people, crews, or staff. This includes your name as well as your behavior. If you make an agreement or deal with someone, you must complete the deal or give back everything you have received if you decide to pull out.

Evading bans and mutes by switching accounts, IPs, computers, etc. is not allowed and will result in harsher punishment on your main account/IP.

## RDM Rules for Civilians

To ensure a fair and enjoyable experience for all players, attacking, shooting at, or killing other players for no reason is strictly prohibited. This also includes intentionally shooting in their direction or at the vehicle that they are currently in.

This rule only applies to civilians / criminals. There are specific combat and RDM rules based on what job you currently have. (WIP) These are shown when starting the job, but you can also read them further down the page.

### Defense of Yourself, Your Friends, and Your Property

You have the right to defend yourself if someone attacks or threatens you, your friends, or your crew verbally (voice & text chat) or physically. Furthermore, you can attack a player that has damaged, stolen, or seized your property

Players that are presumably together with the attacker (e.g. in the same vehicle), are also allowed to be killed in defense. Once you manage to kill the player(s) in question, your defense is fulfilled.

If you are unable to fulfill your defense by killing the player(s), revenge comes into action.

### Revenge

Being attacked, shot at, killed, cuffed, arrested, hunted for your bounty, and getting your property damaged, stolen, or seized gives you the right to take revenge on the player by killing them once. The chain of revenge ends once one player stops. If you happen to kill each other at the same time, your revenge is not satisfied and both players are allowed to take revenge on each other for the kill. If a cop or bounty hunter accepts your bribe offer, you no longer have revenge on them.

If you plan to kill someone in revenge, we recommend clipping the situation that caused revenge using a program like Medal to have proof of what happened. If you don't have proof of revenge for a situation where it's not obvious, you might be punished as per our rules. Your revenge expires if the server restarts.

### Provoking and Stalking

You have the right to kill players that are insulting you, your friends, or your crew, playing insulting emotes near you, playing music or making annoying noises, or honking to provoke you.

Furthermore, you have the right to kill players that are following you around or are engaging you without an apparent reason, unless you are near other unrelated players, or near a Point of Interest like a spawn point, shop, mechanic, ATM, property, etc.

### Competition

You have the right to kill players that are competing and working against you. This includes the following:

* Cops engaging you or your friends while you have an active wanted level
* Civilians or Criminals engaging you or your friends while you have an active bounty
* Medics that are reviving your opponents (cops) or enemies
* Criminals that are joining your robbery without your consent or robbing the same store you were going to rob
* Players stealing the same vehicle you were going to steal
* Players attacking the same player(s) you are attacking
* Drug dealers selling drugs in the same area you're currently selling in or want to sell in

Camping spawns (i.e. cop stations, hospitals) to farm kills is not allowed.

### PvP Zones

PvP Zones (red circle on the map) are a free-for-all. Every player, no matter their current job, is allowed to kill other players within the zone on sight. Both players have to be fully within the zone when engaging in the fight. If you start attacking someone and they flee out of the zone without threatening or attacking you, then you are not allowed to continue attacking them.

### Bounties

If a player has an active bounty (deep red blip & name + bounty amount shown next to their name), you can kill them on sight to collect their bounty.

### Accidents

If you damage or kill someone due to your carelessness or negligence, you are still subject to moderation action. There are exceptions when the situation is completely out of your control, like players running in front of your line of fire, in the middle of the street, using other innocent players as human shields, or when you are having issues with your game or your connection.

If you kill someone accidentally, we recommend clipping the situation using a program like Medal to have proof of what happened. If you don't have proof for a situation where it's not obvious, you may still be punished as per our rules.

## RDM Rules for Cops

To ensure a fair and enjoyable experience for all players, attacking, shooting at, or killing other players for no reason is strictly prohibited. This also includes intentionally shooting in their direction or at the vehicle that they are currently in, as well as carjacking and damaging the property of innocent civilians, other cops, or medics.

This rule only applies when you are actively playing as a Cop. Switching off duty means you have to follow the Civilian rules instead, and switching to another job means that you have to abide by that job's rules instead.

Non-dangerous wanted suspects are only allowed to be stopped using non-lethal methods. If they are fleeing in a vehicle, you can ram their vehicle to disable it. If they are fleeing on foot, you may taze them or use your vehicle at slow speeds to stop them. Once cuffed, you can choose to arrest them, or be corrupt and accept bribe money, which will cost you a bit of XP.

### Defense of Yourself, Other Cops, Medics, and Citizens

You have the right to defend yourself if someone attacks or threatens you. As a cop, you do not have defense of property. Furthermore, you have the duty to defend other cops, medics and citizens. If you witness an attack, you have to intervene and attempt to detain or eliminate the attacker depending on the circumstances.

Wanted suspects that are presumably together with the attacker (e.g. in the same vehicle), are also allowed to be killed in defense. Once you manage to kill the player(s) in question, your defense is fulfilled.

### Dangerous and Hard to Reach Suspects

Wanted suspects that are seen holding a weapon, committing a violent crime, threatening or attacking a player or NPC, or carjacking a player or NPC, are dangerous and can thus be killed on sight if necessary. Furthermore, if a suspect is fleeing in water or using a boat, submarine, helicopter, plane, or parachute, you can kill them, as they are unable to be arrested.

### Revenge

As a cop, you are not allowed to act out your revenge. If you collect revenge as a cop, you have to go off duty to take your revenge. If you plan to kill someone in revenge, we recommend clipping the situation that caused revenge using a program like Medal to have proof of what happened. If you don't have proof of revenge for a situation where it's not obvious, you might be punished as per our rules.

### Most Wanted Players

Criminals that are most wanted, shown by their deep red blip and name, are very dangerous and can thus be killed on sight to protect the population.

### PvP Zones

PvP Zones (red circles on the map) are a free-for-all. Every player, no matter their current job, is allowed to kill other players within the zone on sight. Both players have to be fully within the zone when engaging in the fight.

This also includes intentionally shooting in their direction or at the vehicle that they are currently in, as well as carjacking and damaging the property of innocent civilians, cops, or other medics.

This rule only applies when you are actively playing as a Medic. Switching off duty means you have to follow the Civilian rules instead, and switching to another job means that you have to abide by that job's rules instead.

### Defense of Yourself and Other Medics

You have the right to defend yourself if someone attacks or threatens you or another medic. As a medic, you do not have defense of property. 

Players that are presumably together with the attacker (e.g. in the same vehicle), are also allowed to be killed in defense. Once you manage to kill the player(s) in question, your defense is fulfilled. If the attacker(s) flee, you must retreat and are not allowed to chase them.

### Revenge

As a medic, you are not allowed to act out your revenge. If you collect revenge as a medic, you have to go off duty to take your revenge under the civilian rules.
